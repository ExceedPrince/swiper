# swiper

This was just a practice on the CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

We learned about the libraries and we were told we shouldn't write a whole bunch of code everytime, if we need a feature which has beenalready created by someone, we can use it in our projects.
So this is the first time when I use a library, a swiper.

I'm proud of this work, because I used an empty HTML file, a little CSS, so the main work was in Javascript.
I could create the pic gallery with a for loop, so I shouldn't had to create them each one by one. At this time it was a big deal for me. By now it's only natural.
